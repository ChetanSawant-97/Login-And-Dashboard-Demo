        details : `Metro Exodus was one of the flagship titles for showing off ray tracing abilities when it launched in 2019. The Enhanced Edition builds on that by only working on ray tracing-capable graphics hardware.As the name suggests, the Enhanced Edition brings a slew of improvements. Not only does the game run faster, but it also adds variable rate shading (VRS), advanced ray traced reflections and DLSS 2.1 support for Nvidia GPUs that offers "sharper image details and increased framerates and display resolutions." There's a temporal upscaling option for AMD's cards, too.The enhanced edition of the game is free to owners of Metro Exodus on Steam, Epic Games Store, Microsoft Store, and GOG---no Stadia, Amazon Luna, Linux, or Mac versions. It isn't an upgrade to the base version; so many new features have been added that it's being released as an entire game, hence the new PC requirements.Save files will carry over on Steam, EGS, and GOG, but not the Microsoft Store, sadly. It's also worth noting that progress within levels isn't saved---you'll have to restart each chapter. There is a "chapter unlock" feature that creates a new save with default equipment and resources, but you won't be able to earn achievements using said save slot.`

        title:'Metro Exodus has sold over 200,000 copies on Steam in less than a week',
        imgUrl : 'assets/images/home/news/article2.jpg',
        details : `Back in January 2019, two weeks before release, Metro publisher Deep Silver announced that the latest installment of the franchise would be selling exclusively on Epic's store until February 15, 2020. The news came despite pre-orders for Exodus being available on Steam since its reveal. This led to Valve calling the decision "unfair," and the previous Metro titles getting review bombed by angry fans.
        Metro Exodus' exclusivity deal ended a few days ago, and even though it's been available elsewhere for over a year, plenty of Steam users are buying the game. Speaking during an earnings presentation, Lars Wingefors, CEO of Deep Silver's parent company, Embracer Group, said: "Metro [Exodus] performed well on Epic and I was happy with the performance on the Epic Games Store, but that doesn't say I'm not happy with the Steam performance either, so it's been great [in] the first days."
        "I was happy to see it's been performing well, selling about 200,000 copies already, and surprising to see that one big country in Asia was the biggest country buying the product, very close to America."`

        title:'Metro Exodus is returning to Steam after lengthy Epic Games Store exclusivity',
        imgUrl : 'assets/images/home/news/article3.jpg',
        details : `Metro Exodus, for the unaware, is the latest entry in the survival horror-focused Metro series, and by all accounts, it's a pretty darn good game. Unfortunately, despite being available for pre-order on Steam for quite a while before release, Epic swooped in at the eleventh hour and persuaded publisher Deep Silver to distribute the title exclusively on the Epic Games Store for one year.
        Several other timed Epic exclusives had similar arrangements, but their deals have long since expired (and thus the games are now being sold on other platforms). Metro Exodus was one of the last remnants of Epic's initial exclusive blitz, but its distribution agreement has finally come to an end as well.
        Metro Exodus is officially coming to Steam on February 15, 2020. We don't know how much it'll cost yet (its store page doesn't list a price), but it will likely be $60 – that's $10 less than what the game normally sells for on the Epic Games Store (even on launch). If you haven't had a chance to play the game yet, due to either personal platform preference or some other reason, be sure to add it to your Steam wishlist to be notified when it launches.`

        imgUrl : 'assets/images/home/news/article4.jpg',
        details : `With its large, open areas, Metro Exodus was a big change from the previous two games, which were mostly set in the underground tunnels of Moscow. Two Colonels brought back the claustrophobic atmosphere of Metro 2033 and Metro: Last Light, while the upcoming Sam's Story is described as a "sandbox-survival" expansion by developer 4A Games.

        --- Metro Exodus (@MetroVideoGame) January 27, 2020
        In the DLC, players take on the role of Sam, an American marine who was trapped in Russia following the nuclear apocalypse. We get to guide Sam's path from the Aurora and through Vladivostok's "tsunami-ravaged harbors, ruined industrial buildings, and crumbling residential districts" as he tries to get back home to the US and, hopefully, find his family alive. Expect to discover some new enemies to fight and weapons to play with.
        No word on how much Sam's Story will cost but expect it to be similar to Two Colonel's $7.99 price unless it happens to feature a lot more content. The game arrives on February 11, which is just a few days after Metro Exodus' Epic Store exclusivity deal ends, so it'll be available on both the Steam and Epic storefronts.
        Metro Exodus remains one of our Best PC Games (You Should Be Playing), and Sam's Story could be a great excuse to return to its world.`

Now Metro creator Dmitri Glukhovsky has weighed in on the deal, and he doesn't sound happy.`

        details : `From GameWatcher: "Metro Exodus will not be coming out on Steam, according to the latest press release from Deep Silver, who have now decided to forego Steam altogether in favour of the Epic Games Store. A continuation of the exodus of AAA developers and publishers from Valve's digital marketplace, really.

        With Metro Exodus now an Epic Games Store exclusive, Deep Silver has also disclosed their reasoning for making the switch, thus making it crystally clear that the bottom line is - money."`
